Click on Actions &gt; Translate JSON. In the text area that opens, paste the JSON code and click on Translate JSON.

The feature overwrites all other display options (promote...)</p> <p>This can be very useful for minor sale items that you don't want to advertise with a large banner. This can also be useful for items which do not have a large resolution image.</p> <p>The sticky option can be revoked before, or during the sale item's activity.</p> <p><span class=\"label label-danger\">Common Errors</span> Make sure at least one of the hero items is NOT a sticky hero.

Add the english and french text. Create as many Hello Bar entries as you want. They will be displayed between the start and end date you defined.</p> <p><span class=\"label label-danger\">Fallback</span> If ever the Hello Bar can not load the JSON data or if no Hello Bar item is set to display at the current date, a default message will be displayed in place until a valid message can be collected from the JSON.</p><p><span class=\"label label-warning\">Note</span> The default Hello Bar text can be set in the Theme Customization => Hello Bar => Set Default Hello Text.
