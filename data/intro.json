This file defines the page architecture and includes the necessary scripts, stylesheets, meta information and external data. Apart from adding new JavaScript or css files, most modifications should be made to top level page templates (i.e. collection, product...) as any modification to the theme file will apply site wide, on desktop and mobile versions. It is a best practice to include a new functionality on the theme page by creating this new functionality in a separate <span class=\"ttip\" data-attribute=\"Liquid\">liquid</span> “snippet” and including it in the theme page code."
